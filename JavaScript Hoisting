JavaScript Hoisting
Hoisting refers to the behavior where JavaScript moves the declarations of variables, functions, and classes to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. 
This can sometimes lead to surprising results, especially when using var, let, const, or function expressions.

1. Variable Hoisting with var
When you use var to declare a variable, the declaration is hoisted to the top, but its value is not assigned until the code execution reaches the variable’s initialization.
This results in the variable being assigned undefined during the hoisting phase.
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

output:-
undefined 

The declaration var a is hoisted to the top, but a is initialized with undefined. 
Hence, logging results in undefined.
